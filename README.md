# storefront using mysql & node

this is a command line application using node, the inquirer npm package, the mysql npm package, and of course
a database from mysql workbench.

the application simulates a simple store front, with a table of all available products and their prices, id #'s,
and available units. 

The application will add up your total, and tell you how many items you have purchased once you are done.

If you order more products than are available, you will be told that the order cannot be fulfilled and returned
back to the inventory table.
